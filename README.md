# Blog MERN Stack
## A website to create, store, edit and delete blogs

I created a website which allows a user to manage their blogs. To build this website, I followed the FreeCodeCamp tutorial at https://youtu.be/-42K44A1oMA?si=5xibNUAe2UeTgtrn. The MERN stack is a website stack that uses MongoDB for the database, Express for the web server, React for the JavaScript frontend framework, and Node for the Javascript web server.

Throughout the process, I was able to learn how to use MongoDB for the first time, gain a better understanding of Express and Node, and increase my comfort with using React.
